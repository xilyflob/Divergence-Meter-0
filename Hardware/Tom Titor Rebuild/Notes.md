# Description
These files are versions of Tom Titor's most recent PCB design that were recreated in Eagle. There was no way to directly convert them, so I did my best to copy them by hand.

# Known Differences
* Some of the silk screens involved with parts ended up different than the original. Functional parts like pin 1 markers should be in the right place, but outlines are different in places. This is either due to differences in the standard eagle libraries compared to ExpressPCB or due to me having them be different on a later board design.
* Eagle actually has DRC rules unlike ExpressPCB (as far as I know). These rules can affect the design that is allowed to exist on the board. I used OSH Park's rules that are avalible on their website for free as that was the place I intended to do any board manufacture with at the time. This all boils down to minor differences in some pad sizes and the heat sink area not reaching the edge of the board.
